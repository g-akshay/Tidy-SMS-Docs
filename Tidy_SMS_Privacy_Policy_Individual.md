## 6. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

### 6.1 Firebase Analytics (Google)

I use Firebase by Google to understand how the app is used. Firebase collects anonymized data:

- Feature interactions
- Device type and OS version

**Firebase does NOT collect:** Your SMS content, contacts, phone number, or personal data.

Firebase may store data in Google's servers (including outside India). For details, see: https://policies.google.com/privacy

**Opt Out:** Settings > About > Privacy Settings > Toggle off "Analytics Collection"

### 6.2 Crash Reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)

When the app crashes, Firebase Crashlytics collects:

- Technical error information (stack traces)
- Device information
- App version

**Crash reports do NOT include:** Your SMS content or personal data.

Tidy SMS is completely ad-free. I do not use ads, do not collect data for ad networks, and do not sell your data to advertisers.

## 7. DATA SECURITY

I implement reasonable security measures:

- **Device Encryption:** Your SMS and contacts are protected by Android's built-in security
- **Secure Connection:** Data sent to my servers uses industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS)
- **Limited Access:** Only I can access analytics data
- **Regular Updates:** I keep the app and dependencies updated for security

However, no system is 100% secure. If you suspect your data has been compromised, email me immediately.

## 8. YOUR RIGHTS UNDER INDIAN LAW

Under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, you have these rights:

### 8.1 Right to Access

You can ask for all personal data I hold about you. I will respond within 30 days.

  ​
  -Some minimal diagnostic data may be retained for up to 90 days where required for security, fraud prevention or legal reasons, after which it is deleted or irreversibly anonymised.

Note: Some data may be retained for legal reasons (e.g., crash reports up to 90 days per my policy).
